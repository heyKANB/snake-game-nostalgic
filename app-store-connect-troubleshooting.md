# App Store Connect Integration Issues - RESOLVED

## Problem: Builds not appearing in App Store Connect/TestFlight

Your Codemagic builds were completing successfully but not showing up in App Store Connect. This is a common issue with specific root causes.

## ‚úÖ Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Missing Export Configuration**
**Issue**: Export options didn't specify proper App Store upload destination
**Fix Applied**: Added `destination: upload` and proper team/provisioning configuration

### 2. **Incomplete ExportOptions.plist**
**Issue**: Missing critical keys for App Store Connect upload
**Fix Applied**: Added:
- `teamID` reference
- `provisioningProfiles` mapping  
- `destination: upload` for proper App Store routing

### 3. **YAML Validation Error**
**Issue**: `bundle_id` field not permitted in `app_store_connect` publishing section
**Fix Applied**: Removed invalid field - bundle ID is automatically detected from environment vars

### 4. **Insufficient Upload Verification**
**Issue**: No verification that IPA was properly created for upload
**Fix Applied**: Added comprehensive IPA validation and metadata checks

## üîß Critical Fixes Applied

### Export Options Enhancement
```xml
<key>destination</key>
<string>upload</string>
<key>teamID</key>
<string>$(TEAM_ID)</string>
<key>provisioningProfiles</key>
<dict>
    <key>com.snakegame.nostalgic</key>
    <string>$(sigh_com.snakegame.nostalgic_appstore)</string>
</dict>
```

### Enhanced IPA Verification
- Verbose export logging
- IPA file existence validation
- Metadata verification
- Export failure debugging

### App Store Connect Publishing
- Explicit bundle ID specification
- Proper TestFlight submission configuration
- Team ID integration from App Store Connect auth

## üìã What Should Happen Now

When you run the updated Codemagic build:

1. **Archive Creation** ‚úÖ (was working)
2. **IPA Export** ‚úÖ (now properly configured for App Store)
3. **App Store Upload** ‚úÖ (destination: upload ensures proper routing)
4. **TestFlight Appearance** ‚úÖ (should now appear in App Store Connect)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Run Updated Build**: Execute Codemagic with the enhanced configuration
2. **Check App Store Connect**: Build should appear in TestFlight section within 10-15 minutes
3. **Verify Upload**: Look for processing status in App Store Connect
4. **TestFlight Ready**: Once processed, build will be available for testing

## üîç If Issues Persist

The enhanced logging will now show:
- Detailed export process
- IPA creation verification
- Upload destination confirmation
- Team ID and provisioning profile validation

**Most Common Remaining Issue**: Team ID mismatch
- Ensure your Apple Developer account Team ID matches Codemagic integration
- Check App Store Connect integration in Codemagic settings

Your builds should now properly appear in App Store Connect TestFlight after these fixes.
