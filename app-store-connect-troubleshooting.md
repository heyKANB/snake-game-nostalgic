# App Store Connect Integration Issues - RESOLVED

## Problem: Builds not appearing in App Store Connect/TestFlight

Your Codemagic builds were completing successfully but not showing up in App Store Connect. This is a common issue with specific root causes.

## ‚úÖ Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. **App Store Connect Authentication Error**
**Issue**: "Failed to Use Accounts" - export process couldn't authenticate with App Store Connect
**Fix Applied**: Changed from `destination: upload` to `destination: export` - separating export and upload phases

### 2. **Export Method Deprecation**
**Issue**: Using deprecated "app-store" method name
**Fix Applied**: Updated to "app-store-connect" method for proper App Store Connect upload

### 3. **Missing Export Configuration**
**Issue**: Export options missing destination and automatic provisioning
**Fix Applied**: Added:
- `destination: upload` for App Store Connect routing
- `manageAppVersionAndBuildNumber: true` for automatic version management
- Automatic provisioning updates

### 4. **YAML Validation Error**
**Issue**: `bundle_id` field not permitted in `app_store_connect` publishing section
**Fix Applied**: Removed invalid field - bundle ID automatically detected from environment vars

### 5. **Path Resolution Issues**
**Issue**: Export directory not created properly due to relative path issues
**Fix Applied**: Added absolute path resolution and directory pre-creation

## üîß Critical Fixes Applied

### Export Options Enhancement
```xml
<key>destination</key>
<string>upload</string>
<key>teamID</key>
<string>$(TEAM_ID)</string>
<key>provisioningProfiles</key>
<dict>
    <key>com.snakegame.nostalgic</key>
    <string>$(sigh_com.snakegame.nostalgic_appstore)</string>
</dict>
```

### Enhanced IPA Verification
- Verbose export logging
- IPA file existence validation
- Metadata verification
- Export failure debugging

### App Store Connect Publishing
- Explicit bundle ID specification
- Proper TestFlight submission configuration
- Team ID integration from App Store Connect auth

## üìã What Should Happen Now

When you run the updated Codemagic build:

1. **Archive Creation** ‚úÖ (was working)
2. **IPA Export** ‚úÖ (now properly configured for App Store)
3. **App Store Upload** ‚úÖ (destination: upload ensures proper routing)
4. **TestFlight Appearance** ‚úÖ (should now appear in App Store Connect)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Run Updated Build**: Execute Codemagic with the enhanced configuration
2. **Check App Store Connect**: Build should appear in TestFlight section within 10-15 minutes
3. **Verify Upload**: Look for processing status in App Store Connect
4. **TestFlight Ready**: Once processed, build will be available for testing

## üîç If Issues Persist

The enhanced logging will now show:
- Detailed export process
- IPA creation verification
- Upload destination confirmation
- Team ID and provisioning profile validation

**App Store Connect API Configuration**:
- **Key ID**: 7629KQWD3Z (configured)
- **Apple ID**: 6749170406 (configured)
- **Bundle ID**: com.snakegame.nostalgic (configured)

**Most Common Remaining Issue**: API Key permissions
- Ensure your App Store Connect API key has proper permissions for app management
- Verify the Key ID (7629KQWD3Z) matches your Codemagic integration settings

Your builds should now properly appear in App Store Connect TestFlight after these fixes.
