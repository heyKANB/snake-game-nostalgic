# Privacy Policy Deployment Guide

## Issue Resolved: Jekyll Build Error

The error you encountered was because GitHub Pages expects Jekyll-formatted files, but we created a standard HTML file. Here's the simple solution:

## ✅ Solution: Host via Your Snake Game Server

I've integrated the privacy policy directly into your existing server:

### **Privacy Policy URL**
Once your Snake game is deployed, your privacy policy will be available at:
```
https://your-snake-game-domain.com/privacy
```

### **For App Store Submission**
Use this URL in the App Store Connect privacy policy field when submitting your app.

## Alternative Deployment Options

### Option 1: Use Your Current Server (Recommended)
- ✅ Already implemented in `server/routes.ts`
- ✅ No additional setup needed
- ✅ Same domain as your game
- URL: `https://your-deployed-app.replit.app/privacy`

### Option 2: Deploy to Replit Pages
1. Create a new Replit project
2. Upload `privacy-policy.html`
3. Deploy as static site
4. Get the public URL

### Option 3: Free Static Hosting
Use services like:
- **Netlify**: Drag & drop `privacy-policy.html`
- **Vercel**: Import from GitHub
- **GitHub Pages**: Convert to Jekyll format

## Jekyll-Compatible Version (if needed)

If you still want to use GitHub Pages, create this file instead:

**`privacy.md`**:
```markdown

layout: default
title: Privacy Policy

## Current Status

**Next Step**: Deploy your Snake game and use the resulting privacy URL for App Store submission.
