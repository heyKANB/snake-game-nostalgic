# Encryption Exemption Configuration

## Problem Solved
Apple's App Store Connect was asking encryption questions with each app submission because the app didn't specify its encryption usage in the Info.plist file.

## Solution Applied
Added the following key to `ios/App/App/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption</key>
<false/>
```

## What This Does
- **Skips Encryption Questions**: Apple will no longer ask about encryption with each submission
- **Declares No Custom Encryption**: Indicates the app uses only standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS)
- **Streamlines Submission**: Reduces steps in the App Store Connect submission process

## Why This is Correct for Your App
Your Snake game app:
- Uses only standard HTTPS/TLS for web communications
- Stores data in browser localStorage without custom encryption
- Does not implement proprietary or non-standard encryption algorithms
- Does not use encryption beyond Apple's operating system level

## App Store Review Impact
- No export compliance documentation required
- Standard app review process applies
- Encryption questions automatically answered as "No custom encryption"

This change will take effect with your next app submission and will streamline the App Store Connect process going forward.
