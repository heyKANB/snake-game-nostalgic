# Quick GitHub Setup for Snake Game

## Ready-to-Upload Files ✅
Your Snake game project is completely ready for GitHub with:
- Complete source code (client + server)
- Mobile app packages (iOS + Android)
- Codemagic CI/CD configuration
- PWA files for web installation
- Professional README and documentation

## Simple 3-Step Process:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)
Go to https://github.com → "New repository"
- Name: `snake-game-nostalgic`
- Public repository (for free Codemagic builds)
- Add README, .gitignore, MIT license

### 2. Upload Your Code (3 minutes)
**Easiest method - GitHub website:**
- Click "uploading an existing file" on your repo page
- Drag and drop ALL your project files from Replit
- Commit with message: "Complete Snake game ready for App Store"

**Alternative - Git commands:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/snake-game-nostalgic.git
# Copy all files to cloned folder
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Snake game ready for App Store"
git push
```

### 3. Verify Upload
Check these files are in your GitHub repo:
- `codemagic.yaml` (for automatic iOS builds)
- `ios/` and `android/` folders
- `client/` and `server/` source code
- `README.md` and other config files

## Next: Connect to Codemagic
Once on GitHub, your repository URL will be:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/snake-game-nostalgic`

This is what you'll connect to Codemagic for automatic iOS App Store builds.

Your Snake game is production-ready and will be live on the App Store within days of upload!
